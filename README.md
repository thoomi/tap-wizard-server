## Idea

The main idea behind TapWizard was to develop a game which should renovate the old 
concept of a parlor game, namely to meet with friends, play a game and have fun together, by making 
use of modern technologies. The Smartphone surely is one of these technologies and thatâ€™s why it is 
supposed to be the primarily game controller. It comes with the advantage that almost everyone always 
carries one and thus makes it possible to for users to make spontaneous game sessions. Eventually the 
decision  felt  to  implement  the  famous  card  game  Wizard  as  a  browser  based  multiplayer  game. 
Browser based because of the fact that one is independent from a single operating system and the game 
can be available on all major platforms without installation (provided that a web browser is already 
installed).

## Development

If you plan to use the project make sure to run 

    npm install

in the root folder. And

	grunt serve

in order to start the watch task which restarts the server on each change.
